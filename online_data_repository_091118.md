## Introduction
Today we will mainly introduce two online data repositories of water quality data.
1. [Water Quality Portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us): Co-sponsored by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council (NWQMC). It serves data collected by over 400 state, federal, tribal, and local agencies.
2. [Hydroclient](http://data.cuahsi.org): Online database for hydro-related data (including water quality data) maintained by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI). Multiple institutions are contributing data to this database, including Penn State.

### [Shale Network database](http://www.shalenetwork.org)
1. Identifying and collecting data from groups collecting water data or from publications of data for any time period from the region of extraction of natural gas from Devonian shale in the PA-WV-NY-NJ-VA-OH region, with an emphasis on PA.
2. All data are published to [Hydroclient](http://data.cuahsi.org).

## [Water Quality Portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us)
Detailed instruction to this online database can be found at their [website](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/portal_userguide/). Here I include most essential information that you need to know for downloading water quality data to kick off.
