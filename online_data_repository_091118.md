## Introduction
Today we will mainly introduce two online data repositories of water quality data.
1. [Water Quality Portal (WQP)](https://www.waterqualitydata.us): Co-sponsored by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council (NWQMC). It serves data collected by over 400 state, federal, tribal, and local agencies.
2. [Hydroclient](http://data.cuahsi.org): Online database for hydro-related data (including water quality data) maintained by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI). Multiple institutions are contributing data to this database, including Penn State.

### [Shale Network database](http://www.shalenetwork.org)
1. Identifying and collecting data from groups collecting water data or from publications of data for any time period from the region of extraction of natural gas from Devonian shale in the PA-WV-NY-NJ-VA-OH region, with an emphasis on PA.
2. All data are published to [Hydroclient](http://data.cuahsi.org).

## Water Quality Portal (WQP)
The link to this database is [https://www.waterqualitydata.us](https://www.waterqualitydata.us).

Detailed instruction to how to use this online database can be found at their [website](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/portal_userguide/). Here I include most essential information that you need to know for downloading water quality data to kick off.

### Prior to downloading: 'WWW' Rule
You need to know where, when, and what
1. Where is your research area?
2. When were these samples collected?
3. What water quality parameters (e.g., pH, Alkalinity) do you need? and what type of samples (e.g., surface water or groundwater) would you like?

Suppose we would like to download chloride concentration data in groundwater samples that were collected from 2000 to 2017 and from water wells located in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania.

### Downloading
1. WQP allows users to query data based on 1) County-State-County, 2) Point-Buffer, and 3) Bounding Box. Here we use the first method.
2. Follow my instruction to type in a bunch of search criteria
3. Click  'Show sites on map'
4. Download data for 'Sample results (narrow)' in a desired file format

### After downloading
Note: Since we download data only for one geochemical analyte (i.e., chloride), each row in the downloaded file represent a different sample. If we download multiple analytes together, each different analytes for the same sample will be in different rows and stacked up.

Today's lecture is suppose to be a hands-on session. Please follow the handout and walk yourself through a quick demo: investigating a potential spill in Black Moshannon Creek.
